# Machine_Learning_Classification_Project
This repository contains a complete end-to-end workflow for predicting weather type (e.g., sunny, rainy, foggy, snow) based on meteorological features such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, precipitation, pressure, and visibility. The project includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data cleaning, visualization, and feature understanding.

Feature Engineering: Creation of new numerical and categorical features, handling of skewed distributions, and scaling/encoding for machine learning models.

Modeling: Baseline and final models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, with pipelines for preprocessing and training.

Cross-Validation: Stratified cross-validation to assess model stability and performance consistency.

Evaluation: Metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC) and confusion matrices for both training and unseen test data.

Reproducibility: Preprocessing pipelines, label encoding, and metrics saved for consistent evaluation.

The final Logistic Regression model was selected for deployment based on stable performance, interpretability, and generalization capability.
